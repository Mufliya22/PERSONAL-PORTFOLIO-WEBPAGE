Task 3 – Personal Portfolio Webpage: Description & My Experience

For Task 3 of my internship, I designed and developed a Personal Portfolio Webpage to showcase my skills, projects, education, and experience as a Computer Science engineering student. This task was both creative and technically enriching, as it allowed me to combine design with functionality to represent myself professionally online.

The main objective of this task was to build a fully responsive and visually appealing portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my development environment due to its powerful extensions and user-friendly interface, which helped me write, debug, and format code efficiently.

The structure of the portfolio included the following key sections:

Home/About Me – introducing myself and my career goals.

Skills – showcasing my technical and soft skills.

Projects – displaying descriptions of projects I’ve completed, such as the Interactive Quiz App and Real-Time Chat Application, with links or screenshots.

Education – listing my school and college background.

Contact – providing contact details or a form for others to reach out.


One of the highlights of this task was using CSS to add animations, hover effects, and layout designs that made the webpage more attractive. I also used icons, custom fonts, and color themes to make the site reflect my personal style while maintaining professionalism.
